       <p>A simple timeline of the life and achievements of Alan Turing, the great mathematician, World War II hero, computer scientist and visionary. </p>
       <ul>
         <li><strong>JUN 23, 1912-
Birth</strong>: 
Alan Mathison Turing was born on June 23, 1912 in Maida Vale, London.
</li>
         <li><strong>AUG 19, 1926- Early Signs of Intelligence</strong>: At the age of 13, Alan Turing first showed signs of intelligence and potential which was noticed at the Sherborne School.
</li>
         <li><strong>AUG 29, 1931-
Getting Serious About Technology</strong>: Alan Turing studied from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, in Cambridge. He was first in his class and was an honor student in the field of mathematics. </li>
         <li><strong>SEP 30, 1936-
Studied at Princeton University
</strong>: Turing studied mathematics and cryptology while also building three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier at Princeton University.</li>
         <li><strong>DEC 6, 1939-
Hut 8
</strong>: Turing helped to solve the essential part of the German naval indicator system and also came up with the idea of sequential analysis.

</li>
         <li><strong>MAR 18, 1940-
Bombe
</strong>: Turing was responsible for creating the Bombe which was a cryptanalytic machine used to decrypt the Enigma-enciphered messages being sent from the enemies.</li>
         <li><strong>NOV 29, 1942-
Travels to US</strong>: Turing traveled to the United States to work with the US naval cryptanalysts to create their version of the Bombe and an Enigma in Washington.
</li>
         <li><strong>FEB 19, 1946-
Presented Paper
</strong>: He presented his paper in February of 1946 where he had presented the first detailed design of a stored program computer setup.</li>
         <li><strong>SEP 13, 1947-
ACE
</strong>: Turing lived in Hampton, London where worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine).
</li>
         <li><strong>MAR 19, 1948-
LU decomposition method
</strong>: Turing created the LU decomposition method that was used and is still used today to solve matrix equations.</li>
         <li><strong>AUG 31, 1948-
Software for stored-program computers
</strong>: Turing was appointed a position in the mathematics department at the University of Manchester where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers.
</li>
         <li><strong>APR 29, 1950-
Turing Test</strong>: The turing test was created in 1950. The turing test was created to compare the intelligence of a machine/computer to the intelligence of a human brain.
</li>
         <li><strong>JAN 29, 1952-
Book Published
</strong>: Turing's book "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis" was published in 1952 which was all about his interest in the biology of organisms</li>
         <li><strong>JUN 8, 1954-
Death</strong>: Turing committed suicide in his house where his housekeeper found him dead.</li>

     <p>His genius embraced the first visions of modern computing and produced seminal insights into what became known as “artificial intelligence.” As one of the most influential code breakers of World War II, his cryptology yielded intelligence believed to have hastened the Allied victory.</p>
